# AcidTrip

To be updated. Project done in 2015. A lot of stuff's broken. 

What I know so far:
1. It needs this: [http://ubaa.net/shared/processing/opencv/](http://ubaa.net/shared/processing/opencv/)
2. It runs as a 32-bit application (64 does not work - so if you're using Windows, download and use the right version)
3. It might need an older version of Processing (maybe 2.x). I'm not sure about this part. 

[PSmile](https://github.com/chungbwc/PSmile) by [Bryan Chung](http://www.magicandlove.com/blog/2011/05/04/smile-detection-in-processing-mac-osx/) is also included in this repo for some tests that I did. I did not find a license on his code, but that section was written by him. It's not needed for the visual effect though.
